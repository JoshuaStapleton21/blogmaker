<title> The Seven Meanings of Life </title>

<p><strong>Life is many things. And so maybe this stupid, beautiful question has many answers.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is the meaning of life?" "To be happy," I answered. "What is happiness?" "To be at peace with oneself." "What is that?" "To be in love," I said. "With whom?" "With no one. With everything." "How do you act in love?" "By doing," I said.</p></li>
<li><p>The question is a little too broad. Life comes with meaning. It is given to us as we grow up. It comes in the form of various experiences and lessons. And though we are given our current sense of life, we are also given the ability to change it. This is the meaning of life. We are all given the power to change it. We are given the ability to create meaning in our lives. The meaning of life is the meaning that you give to it.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of life?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the meaning of life?" "To be happy," said Bodhidharma. "But what is happiness?" "To be happy," said Bodhidharma. "But what is the meaning of happiness?" "To be happy," said Bodhidharma. "But what is the meaning of happiness?" "To be happy," said Bodhidharma. "But what is the meaning of ..." "To be happy," said Bodhidharma. "But ..." "To be happy," said Bodhidharma.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the meaning of life?" and the answer is that you come to realize that life is not the meaning of life. Life is a tiny little thing that comes to exist for a moment and then disappears. And when you see that, when you know that, you become free. You are no longer willing to be caught up in the material world. You are no longer willing to die for a meaningless cause. If there is nothing to life, and I can die at any moment, then why am I here? Why am I doing this? If you see the true nature of the world, if you see the impermanence of everything, then you begin to realize the meaning of life. You come to see that the meaning of life is to give life meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not sure anyone has ever asked this question, but I'm certain that everyone has an answer to it. The problem is that most people have the wrong answer. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the meaning of life is "the reason for which something exists." But what if you don't have a reason for which something exists? Does this mean that purposeless things don't exist? As a kid, I never saw my life as having a meaning. I never saw a reason why I existed. I was just a kid. There were more important things to me than life's meaning. I thought that I would discover this meaning when I grew up. And then I grew up. And I'm still asking.</p></li>
