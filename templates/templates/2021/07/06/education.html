<title> Musings on Education </title>

<p>Theories of education are as diverse as they are detailed. Constructivism emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, giving rise to the idea that learners are not passive recipients of information, but that they actively construct their knowledge in interaction with the environment and through the reorganization of their mental structures. Learners are therefore viewed as sense-makers, not simply recording given information but interpreting it.</p>
<p>The Vygotskyâ€“Piaget model of cognitive development that emerged from the cultural-historical theory suggests that higher order thinking skills are developed through the internalization of logical mental processes. The activity is the most important way for development to take place. The concept of activity was introduced by Lev Vygotsky, who based his Theory of Development on it.</p>
<p>Vygotsky's theory of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) also focuses on a balance between individual and social learning, as well as the relationship between learning mediated by tools, and learning mediated by interaction with others. Vygotsky's theory challenges the behaviorist approach to psychology that was dominant at the time it was developed.</p>
<p>Theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) focuses on intelligence as an array of different abilities, each being independent from one another. It is argued that these multiple intelligences exist due to different modalities in which we acquire information, not because we are smarter or dumber than other people. Howard Gardner's theory suggests that we possess not only different modes for acquiring information (visual, auditory, etc.) but also different ways to interpret information once it has been obtained. Thus, our minds have many ways of making sense out of experience and using these senses to make connections between experiences is what leads us to develop efficiently in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Theory of Personal Intelligence (PI) refers to one's personal and individualized abilities regarding Problem Solving, Self-Awareness and Management Skills. These abilities are related to Task Completion and Learning Potential respectively. Piaget's developmental stages describe a quantitative approach towards intelligence; however Piaget himself did not focus exclusively on this aspect but rather on qualitative aspects such as adaptation and assimilation in his work with children. Theory of Personal Intelligence focuses more on qualitative growth patterns rather than intellectual levels or stages.</p>
<p>Individualized education is a progressive theory based on the premise that every person has unique needs for education based upon their interests and environment. The idea is that education should be tailored to meet each learner's needs rather than everyone receiving a specific curriculum designed for the average learner. This theory is closely linked with constructivist theories of education in which knowledge is viewed as being constructed by learners rather than simply passed down from an authority figure such as a teacher or textbook author. One significant example of this philosophy in action can be seen in Project Follow Through from the 1960s through 1980s when an experimental curriculum was implemented into schools across the United States with varying degrees of success (Project Follow Through). Individualized education continues today as evidenced by sites such as Khan Academy and Duolingo which allow students or users to take control over their own education using online resources at their convenience.</p>
