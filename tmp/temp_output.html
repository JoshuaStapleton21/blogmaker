<p>Below, I‚Äôve compiled a list of short (2-5 sentence) horror stories written by GPT-3. The prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Topic: Breakfast
Two-Sentence Horror Story: He always stops crying when I pour the 
milk on his cereal. I just have to remember not to let him see his 
face on the carton.
- - - - - - - - - 
Topic: Silence, Wind</code></pre>
<p>is mediocre at best. It barely makes sense at all. Regardless, the AI yielded a couple of very fascinating (and also very deranged) outputs. Here are a few of them, listed in order of increasing derangement - my favorite order ;).</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start of with some of the more poetically nuanced, even tragic responses:</p>
<pre><code>The wind is angry tonight. The trees are swaying back and forth 
and the branches are rustling. I always blame the wind when the 
trees start to dance.</code></pre>
<p>This is barely horror, however, it captures a feeling of ominous unease essential to the beginning of any masterful thriller. Here, we glimpse the beautiful imagery of dancing trees, yet it is twisted: marred by the bite of words like <em>blame</em>. This is excellent writing (for an AI) - we might compare it to the flower-wreathed tableaus of <em>Midsommar</em>. *Chefs Kiss*</p>
<pre><code>My love for him was the raging wind that swept me off my feet and carried 
me through the dark night. But it was the gentle breeze that drifted through 
my hair when he finally left that broke me.</code></pre>
<p>Also not really horror (although the manic revenge of a woman scorned is likely). Here we have a beautiful, multi-sentence metaphor, even if it is kinda goth. The wind rages, it drifts: it fulls many roles, takes many colors. One can all but feel the cold rains of the moor as one runs, draped in a white, thin shawl, hacking into a bloody handkerchief. Jane Eyre could never.</p>
<pre><code>It&#39;s been almost twenty years since she&#39;s last spoken to me, but 
I&#39;m still waiting for her to say something. She&#39;s so beautiful, 
even when she&#39;s not speaking.</code></pre>
<p>Here is our first glimpse of classic horror. This piece is more subtle than many of the other responses, as the terror is not in what is said, but what is implied. Why does she not speak? Is she mute? Is she breathing? Very very nice.</p>
<pre><code>The silence in the car is worse than the screaming. 
I can&#39;t stand it when she doesn&#39;t talk to me.</code></pre>
<p>A similar sentiment - we catch a glimpse into the mind of the writer - an excellent technique in horror. By exposing the thoughts of the narrator, this piece provides realism, understanding - a powerful enzyme for fear.</p>
<pre><code>I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s still alive! It&#39;s been years since he&#39;s left the attic. 
Sometimes I think I hear him whispering to the wind, and I can&#39;t help but wonder 
how long it will be before the wind takes his words away again.</code></pre>
<p>Mmmmmmmmm. Tasty. Thematic consistency is always a plus in any good tale, albeit one that is two sentences long.</p>
<pre><code>The wind was so loud, I didn&#39;t hear the door open. I wish I had.</code></pre>
<p>Simple, to the point. Who knew AI could learn to foreshadow?</p>
<pre><code>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m more afraid of: the silence or of what it means.</code></pre>
<p>I like this one a lot. Very open-ended. The tension is palpable, yet cannot be pinned down. It is infinitely more terrifying to not know the nature of that which is threatening you, than to know it.</p>
<pre><code>The wind whispered to me. He said he could make me fly if I wanted to.</code></pre>
<p>Here we have some delightful personification, even though it is slightly vague. <em>Whispering wind?</em> That‚Äôs both anthromorphicism and alliteration! Stephen King is quaking.</p>
<pre><code>The wind always howls when I&#39;m in bed, and I always wake up before 
I can see the source of the sound.</code></pre>
<p>This one is a bit confusing, however, the spice is very much there. Can I see the wind? Does it matter because AM I AWAKE?!?!</p>
<pre><code>A strong gust of wind blew the front door open, and a tornado entered my house, 
destroying pretty much everything in it.</code></pre>
<p>There‚Äôs not much else to this really! Simply descriptive. No subtleties here!</p>
<pre><code>The wind was not the only thing that was knocked out of me after the car accident.</code></pre>
<p>I mean‚Ä¶ sure? Cool I guess? We‚Äôve definitely crossed the threshold of derangement now.</p>
<pre><code>I was homeless for weeks, wandering the streets of my hometown, until the wind 
swept me up and carried me here.</code></pre>
<p>This is a masterpiece in existentialism. Wizard of Oz who? <em>Laws of physics who?</em></p>
<pre><code>Never use your hands to cover your mouth when you sneeze. 
Always use your elbow.</code></pre>
<p>I‚Ä¶ have no words. It‚Äôs not even ‚ÄòelbowS‚Äô plural, but ‚Äòelbow‚Äô. PLEASE.</p>
<pre><code>They call it wind because it makes you turn inside-out.</code></pre>
<p>This is the content I am here for. D.E.R.A.N.G.E.D. beyond belief. ‚ÄúThey call it wind‚Äù: yes, they actually do ü§Ø. This horror is about as effective as saying ‚Äúthey call it walking, because you‚Äôll come back without any <em>bOnEs in your bOdY</em>.‚Äù Comedians should honestly give up at this point.</p>
<p>So that is the list! Thank you for reading - I hope you enjoyed this post - I certainly did XD. Please <a href="mailto:@joshua.stapleton.ai@gmail.com">email</a> me if you would like to dispute my ordering choices. You‚Äôre wrong, but I appreciate the effort :D.</p>
