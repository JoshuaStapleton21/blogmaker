<p>Once upon a time , in the 1700â€™s, an independent African kingdom was established in what is now Liberia. For over 100 years the nation survived as an independent nation, but in 1867 it was sold by the King of the time to the United States. The African Kingdom then became a colony of the U.S.A. for over 50 years. In 1929, the colony of Liberia was established and recognized by the League of Nations. The League of Nations was an organization which at that time was responsible for the creation and nurturing of new nations.</p>
