<p>Once upon a time , a little boy named Walter came into the world. He was a very round baby, so his mother named him Walter Round. His mother was always very proud of him because Walter always did everything she told him. Walter would never fight with his siblings, he would never cry because of his pain, and he would never refuse to eat his vegetables. He was a very good boy and he loved to play with his family. On an especially hot summer day, Walter went to play with his friends. He had a bag full of worms as well as some marbles. He played with them all day long and had a great time. After all, worms and marbles were the best toys he could ever have because they could never tell on him. Walter decided to give some worms to his friends and he soon realized he did not have enough in his bag. He decided to dig more worms so he could share with his friends. He went outside to try to dig some up, but he noticed several holes in the ground. He decided to see if there were any worms in the holes and he stuck his hands in them. While he was playing with the worms, he noticed a beautiful butterfly flying overhead. Walter was very excited to catch the butterfly so he could put it in his bag with the worms and marbles. Walter also noticed that the butterfly had a beautiful gold coating over its wings, so he decided to grab it and see if he could get the gold. He grabbed the butterfly and pulled off one of its wings. When he did that, the butterfly began to bleed. Walter was worried about the poor butterfly, so he decided to try to put the wing back on. He put the wing back on and kissed the butterfly. The butterfly began to fly again and Walter started to play with his friends again. Walter never thought about the butterfly because he had so much fun playing with his friends. After dinner, Walter walked outside to play again and he was surprised to see the same butterfly he had tried to help. He ran up to it and tried to say hello, but the butterfly was very angry. It said, “Hey, Walter Round, you gave me a hole in my wing and a good scare. Now, I will give you a hole in the head and put a good scare in you.” The butterfly flew at Walter and hit him in the head and he was very scared. The butterfly then flew away and Walter had a big hole in his head. When his mother saw the hole in her son’s head, she was very scared and she called an ambulance. Walter was rushed to the hospital and was taken care of. A few days later, the doctors told Walter’s mother that the hole in his head was going to stay with him for the rest of his life. Walter’s mother was furious and she told him that he should not have played with the butterfly. Walter was very sad, but he knew that he shouldn’t have played with the butterfly and that he should have just left it alone. The moral of this story is: “Don’t play with butterflies because you might get a hole in your head.”</p>
