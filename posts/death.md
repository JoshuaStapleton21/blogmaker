[title]: <> (Death: What To Choose When There Are No Choices)

Something is better than nothing. 

This is our starting point. We do not define the 'something' in question. In fact, we might extend our definition to 'anything is better than nothing' but this is beside the point. Nothing is bad, everything is good.

It has been said that their are things worse than Death, but this is a fallacy. Death is nothing: absence, void; to say that their are things worse than Death are to say that their are things worse than nothing, which is fundamentally untrue. Because of this, existence is better than non-existence. 

Everything that lives changes, everything that dies does not. Even if there is no joy in life, only hatred, pain, suffering, and despair, it is still better than Death, because life is something, and something is open to change. To live is to hope. Sisyphus will push his bolder for 10,000 years, yet believe that even Hades might crumble, and among the rubble, he might find respite.

**WE MUST DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO AVOID DEATH.** We must. There is no excuse, no but, no reasoning, no philosophical acceptance. There cannot be understanding, silence, resignation, there cannot be final breath. This is the only problem. The single problem of all humanity. 

So what is the solution to this grand problem? What can we choose when their are no choices? Where do we turn in the face of all-encompassing *end of all things*?

Choice, ultimately, is an illusion in the shadow of such a thing. All free will and hope, all love and justice, comes to swift conclusion with final breath. We are not free, we never are and never will be. We are shackled by the scythe of Death - accepting this is rationality.

But we humans were never very good at pure rationality. Faced with the horror of death, there is not a single person, even the greatest human minds, who did not fall into insidious self-deception. We de-rationalize Death, and we have never had a choice in the matter. We convince ourselves that it will be ok. Flock like sheep to religion, or atheism, or science, or jobs, or love, or anything - any pursuit or means to forget death for but a second, and the second after that, and the second beyond that, until no more seconds come. This is our greatest shield against Death - our mind: like an atmosphere protecting us from the indiscriminate emptiness beyond.

### A Common Deception
One such deception is optimistic nihilism. As if there was such a thing. It soothes that something is better than nothing, yes, but nothing is nothing is nothing is nothing. Once we are nothing, we will be nothing; there is no will to be, there is no being to will, there simply is not, and never will be. Once we are gone, all eternity will pass in the blink of an eye. The dust finally settles. The curtain closes. The stars fizzle out. Black holes stop spinning. But Death cares not, for Death cannot care. There is no memory of what was, or what is or what is to come. There is not.

I can't say much more on the subject. I've done my best to express a concept that is far beyond my human understanding; that in Death there is nothing, and because of this, there is no cause for concern.

Obviously, this is flawed in many ways. There is no optimism - how can there be in something that static, in something that is dead?

### A Slightly Better Idea
It is clear that while night is inescapable, we cannot go gentle. Our greatest enemy, that great, deceptive kindness inside our own skull will do everything in its power to convince us otherwise. I separate that stupid grey matter from the self for sake of metaphor, in reality, there is no separation. We cannot convince our minds to neglect their greatest role. Yet we must try nonetheless. After all, we are still breathing, and breath is hope for change, even impossible change.

WE MUST DENY DEATH. We must rage against it; crush its head. We cannot waste another moment. I beg you now - stop reading these words. Devote your life to this great revolution.

Too long has the reaper terrorized the generations of this species. Too long . He is personally responsible for .

Thing about the decades of aging, think about the greying of hair, the dimming of the vision, the quietening of the heart. The slowing of breath. The nigh-imperceptible. Imagine 20 years of aging in a month. Imagine the horror of seeing every single one human being on planet earth infected by this incurable disease, decaying before your eyes, until it killed them. Now, imagine something infinitely worse: acceptance. Imagine each of the infected turning their own minds from reality, accepting, even welcoming their own demise.

There is no need for imagination. This plays out before our very eyes and we watch and do nothing, our own vision dimming, and with it, hope itself.
