Luca was a boy from the small village of San Martino. The villagers were not very rich and generally lived by fishing, farming, and occasional small-time trading. Most of them hoped that their children would be able to live better lives. The local school in San Martino was not very good, but still people wanted their children to study in there. Children were expected to become fishermen or farmers. In the time of World War I, the small town had the highest child mortality rate in the world.
