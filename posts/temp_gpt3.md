Once upon a time 
              , if you wanted to travel across a large body of water, you needed a boat. While most of us don't need a boat anymore, you can still make the trip across water, just without the boat. You'll visit five large and exotic islands in the tropical world of Riven. Each one offers its own atmosphere and environment, and some have a few surprises in store for you. The journey to these islands has its dangers, but there are plenty of challenges to keep you occupied along the way. Explore the treacherous ruins of ancient civilizations, escape hungry predators, and beat the odds in the grand game. At the end, you'll face the greatest challenge of all: the wrath of the gods themselves. The world of Riven is filled with beautiful environments, dangerous creatures, compelling challenges, and tricky puzzles.
